## Instructions

These instructions will walk you through capturing images of your tongue in various positions for use in our classifier.

1. When you open the page, it will request access to your webcam. Make sure to *allow access*. If you instead get a message indicating your device isn't supported, switch to a browser or device that meets the prerequisites above.
2. You will see your camera input on the screen, with an overlaid green box and a red dot. Position the camera so the green box overlays your mouth.
3. Open your mouth (at a comfortable angle), and point your tongue at the red dot while keeping the green box in position.
4. Hold your position and click or tap the camera button. It will turn gray while it captures and uploads the images.
5. Once the camera button lights back up, the red dot will move to the next position. Repeat steps 2-4 until the site redirects you to the "Thank you" page.
